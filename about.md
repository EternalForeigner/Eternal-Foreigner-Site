# About Me

My name is Andrew. I'm an American currently living in Europe, and this website serves as a way for me to document my experiences living abroad, traveling, and useful things that I've learned.

## Why "Eternal Foriegner"?

I guess this name comes from the fact that I don't feel like I "belong" even in my own home country. I have plans to visit and live in other countries in the future, so for this the name suits me. But even when returning "home" to visit, I feel like an outsider. It sounds sad but I don't see it as a good or bad thing, it's just a thing.
